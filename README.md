**CLI-AGENT** is an AI-powered command-line assistant that helps you manage development tools and environments using natural language commands. It supports cross-platform tool installation, uninstallation, updates, version checks, and code generation, all through a conversational interface. CLI-AGENT integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for advanced automation and seamless developer experience.

## PROJECT SCOPE

The assistant will:
- Understand natural language commands related to development environment setup.
- Detect the host operating system (Linux/macOS) and tailor commands accordingly.
- Use the OpenAI API to generate shell-level instructions dynamically.
- Interact directly with the OS via Pythonâ€™s `subprocess`, `os`, and other system libraries.
- Support integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to pull context-aware metadata about user or project environments.

##  KEY TECHNOLOGIES

| Component            | Technology Used             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Language Model       | OpenAI API (no Hugging Face) |
| Backend Logic        | Python                      |
| API Layer (if needed later) | FastAPI (optional, for future extensibility) |
| System Interaction   | Python libraries: `os`, `platform`, `subprocess`, etc. |
| MCP Integration      | REST/CLI-based interaction with MCP metadata sources |

## INITIAL RELEASE FEATURES

- OS detection and environment probing
- CLI interface for accepting user prompts
- Basic command generation using OpenAI
- Simple package installations or file edits based on LLM output
- Basic support for MCP context (stubbed or simulated)

##  DATA PLAN

This project uses three main data sources:
- **User Input**: Natural language prompts entered via the CLI.
- **System Metadata**: OS and configuration details gathered using Python tools.
- **LLM Output**: Shell commands and environment steps generated by the OpenAI API.
In addition, evaluation data is crafted manually to validate system accuracy and safety.

## TEAM

This project is developed by a team of 5 master's students over a 3-month sprint. It prioritizes working functionality over novelty, with reuse and adaptation of existing methods encouraged where appropriate.
