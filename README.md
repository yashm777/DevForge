# CLI-Based AI Agent for Automated Development Environment Setup

This project is a command-line AI assistant designed to automate the setup of development environments on Linux and macOS systems. It allows users to describe their setup needs using natural language commands, which the AI interprets and executes as system-level operations like package installations, file modifications, or environment configurations.

## Project Scope

The assistant will:
- Understand natural language commands related to development environment setup.
- Detect the host operating system (Linux/macOS) and tailor commands accordingly.
- Use the OpenAI API to generate shell-level instructions dynamically.
- Interact directly with the OS via Python’s `subprocess`, `os`, and other system libraries.
- Support integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to pull context-aware metadata about user or project environments.

##  Key Technologies

| Component            | Technology Used             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Language Model       | OpenAI API (no Hugging Face) |
| Backend Logic        | Python                      |
| API Layer (if needed later) | FastAPI (optional, for future extensibility) |
| System Interaction   | Python libraries: `os`, `platform`, `subprocess`, etc. |
| MCP Integration      | REST/CLI-based interaction with MCP metadata sources |

## Initial Release Features

- OS detection and environment probing
- CLI interface for accepting user prompts
- Basic command generation using OpenAI
- Simple package installations or file edits based on LLM output
- Basic support for MCP context (stubbed or simulated)

##  Data Plan

This project uses three main data sources:
- **User Input**: Natural language prompts entered via the CLI.
- **System Metadata**: OS and configuration details gathered using Python tools.
- **LLM Output**: Shell commands and environment steps generated by the OpenAI API.
In addition, evaluation data is crafted manually to validate system accuracy and safety.

## Team

This project is developed by a team of 5 master's students over a 3-month sprint. It prioritizes working functionality over novelty, with reuse and adaptation of existing methods encouraged where appropriate.
